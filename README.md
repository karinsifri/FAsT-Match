# FAsT-Match
FAsT-Match (Fast Affine Template Matching) is an algorithm designed by Simon Korman, Daniel Reichman, Gilad Tsur and Shai Avidan [(source)](https://www.cs.haifa.ac.il/~skorman/FastMatch/index.html) to search a fixed template inside an image, using the B&B technique.
This is a python implementation of the FAsT-Match algorithm with threshold learning option.
